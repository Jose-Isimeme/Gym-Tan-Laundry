# Basic idea as of 5/12/20


-Use spotify api to get the top “most popular songs” on spotify (90+),
-User logs in and creates an account, 
-Plays a random song, 
-User gets a pop-up (modal) with a selection of feelings that will categorize the song, 
-That category compiles into a playlist of songs they voted as that particular mood, 
-They can also add an anonymous comment
